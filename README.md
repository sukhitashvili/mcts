# Monte Carlo Tree Search for Tic-Tac-Toe game playing

Python implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe game playing.

Run the command ```python play_X.py``` or ```python play_O.py``` to play against the agent which uses MCTS algorithm based on random roll-out policy to find optimal moves.

You will see that despite of random roll-out policy algorithm easily finds out optimal moves, which emphasizes algorithm's power.
